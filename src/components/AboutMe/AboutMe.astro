      >Hi! I’m <strong>Javier García Domínguez</strong>, a junior web and software developer who strongly cares for technological
      innovation and creativity. I specialize in <strong>designing</strong> and <strong>developing</strong> web and desktop applications focused on delivering
      seamless and engaging user experiences. My goal is to integrate <strong>efficient technological solutions</strong> while continuously improving the platforms I work on.
      <br />
      In addition to my development skills, I have a keen interest in the potential web creation in <strong>augmented
      reality (AR)</strong>. These technology enable new ways of enhancing user interaction and delivering more <strong>immersive 
      experiences</strong>, allowing me to explore innovative solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible in the digital world.
