      Hi! I’m <strong>Javier García Domínguez</strong>, a front-end developer with experience
      building modern and interactive web applications. I focus on creating
      <strong>clean, fast, and visually engaging interfaces</strong>, working mainly with <strong>React,
      JavaScript, and TypeScript</strong>, and always paying close attention to user
      experience and performance.
    </p>
    <p class="presentation">
      I’m especially interested in interactive and
      <strong>immersive web experiences</strong>, including 3D graphics and animations with
      <strong>Three.js and WebGL</strong>. I enjoy exploring new technologies and experimenting
      with creative solutions that enhance how users interact with the web,
      while continuously improving my skills and the quality of the products I
      work on.
